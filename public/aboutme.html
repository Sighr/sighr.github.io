		Hey! My name is Alexey Smekhunov and this is my resume and aboutme page!
	</h3>
	<div>
		<h3>Who am I?</h3>
		<span>Well...</span>
		<ul>
			<li>23 years old</li>
			<li>Russian student, almost-graduate with Master's degree in Computer Science, already having Bachelor degree in Computer Science</li>
			<li>Young developer who's already worked with many technologies</li>
			<li>Passionate game developer and gamer</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h3>My skills (hey, it's a resume)</h3>
		<span>Programming and general development</span>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<h4>General</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Imperative procedural programming skills. No matter what the language is.</li>
					<li>Algorithms and data structures. I had passed several courses regarding algorithms and data structures. Able to implement most of the common algorithms and data structures on different levels (A* on graph as a list of edges or treap sorting, for example)</li>
					<li>
						<div>Code design and architecture, system design.</div>
						<div>Design patterns - GoF, GRASP. Have read about them, used and applied them. Still did not master them, though.</div>
						<div>Optimizations - finding bottlenecks, checking memory and speed complexities (big O, little o and theta notations).</div>
						<div>Parallelization principles, parallelization primitives - mutex, barrier, semaphore, conditional variables. Dealing with deadlocks, livelocks and race conditions. Parallelization using threads, processes, cluster.</div>
						<div>Asynchronous programming - using callbacks</div>
						<div>Event-driven design. I'm aware of danger of callback hell.</div>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Languages</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<div>C/C++ - these are my first languages to learn. Have been studying C++ from school times (around 2013), get to C in university.</div>
						<div>C - Low-level program organization, stack and heap, compilation and linking processes, raw pointer manipulation.</div>
						<div>C++ - "C with classes", templates, standard library (STL)</div>
					</li>
					<li id="languages-js">Javascript - the most convinient thing to use when you need something really simple. I don't like the idea of Typescript. <a href="#web-js">Web</a></li>
					<li>C# - I used it in Unity mostly. Do not know .NET, but able to write something with Mono.</li>
					<li>SQL - I can write complex queries given some time.</li>
					<li>Python - easy tool to do some scientific research (numpy, scipy, pandas, tensorflow, matplotlib) or get a server up (<a href="#web-django">django</a>).</li>
					<li>I tried a bunch of other languages including Go (several little server projects with complex logic), Java (got one course and zero projects) and PHP. I'm not all unfamiliar with these but there's not any significant knowledge or experience to show.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Web</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>HTML, CSS - basic and simple. This site shows my skills in pure HTML and CSS better than I can tell. But I know about CSS selectors priorities.</li>
					<li id="web-js">Pure js/node.js - I know all the basics and can solve any solvable problem given some time. Sometimes it happens instantly. I don't know jquery, it's not pure js.<a href="#languages-js">Web</a></li>
					<li>React - used it dozen of times. I do not like it, but it gets the job done. Used wouter to navigate. Used class-based components as well as function-based ones with hooks. Know about the virtual DOM</li>
					<li id="web-django">Python/Django - used it dozens of times. Once used DRF. Capable of creating simple CRUD servers as well as complex business servers. Do not have any experience integrating third-party libraries (e.g. payment) there.</li>
					<li>HTTP knowledge - basic. There are headers, then there's body. Headers configure many things, some can be easily recalled, others can be checked in the documentation. Setting up CORS policy to serve content from different servers is not fun.</li>
					<li>Lower-level protocols - TLS/SSL -> TCP/UDP -> IP -> Ethernet. There are others, but this stack is pretty common. I can explain OSI model and look up for details in RFCs.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Software</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<div>Linux - I have Ubuntu as main system (Windows as second). Several times I've used Slackware, Debian and Centos in different tasks.</div>
						<div>Bash scripting - capable of writing simple scripts and using basic shell programs. (I know regular expressions)</div>
						<div>Make, cmake</div>
						<div>Networking - once or twice I had to configure network to get servers running and connect different machines.</div>
					</li>
					<li>Unity</li>
					<li>CAD packages - NX, Ansys, Autodesk products. It's the main topic of my first education.</li>
					<li>Jetbrains tools. I use appropriate IDE for every language and I absolutely love it.</li>
					<li>Git</li>
					<li>Databases: mysql, postgres, mongodb. Can design database structure (tables, triggers, procedures) and make some little optimizations on perfomance (set index). Also understand concepts of users, groups and permissions.</li>
					<li>There are different tools I used once or several times but did not get any significant experience. Matlab, solidworks, blender, krita, unreal engine, godot, nginx. I'm sure I forgot some.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>General</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<div>Math</div>
						<div>I have solid enough base knowledge from university: Integrals ans ODEs, Linear Algebra, Probability Theory, Computational Math, Optimization Methods.</div>
					</li>
					<li>
						<div>Computers</div>
						<div>From physics of electrons to RAM organization. I'm not sure if I can build something computer-like from components without cheatsheets, but I believe I'm close to it.</div>
						<div>Microcontrollers as well. Have some experience with programming those as a hobby, but still did not implemented my dream of tea robot.</div>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<span>Soft skills and general</span>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<div>English language - IELTS 7.5. It's not native or fully fluent but I feel comfortable about it.</div>
				<div>Russian - Native</div>
				<div>I was once learning French and German: able to translate written text with dictionary (understand grammar) and pronounce it. Not even A1.</div>
			</li>
			<li>Able to understand something complicated and explain it to somebody else. I have plenty of explaining experience as I helped my roommates in campus.</li>
			<li>I'm a quick learner. I didn't spend a lot of time memorizing stuff and still I graduated from both school and university with honors (excellent marks in almost all subjects).</li>
			<li>Capable to talk to people. It sounds stange, but ability to start conversation and maintain it for some time while exchanging useful information (attention is useful) helps a lot.</li>

	<br>
	<span>Some other rather random facts about me I cannot categorize or find irrelevant to put above</span>
	<ul>
		<li>Sport: volleyball (setter/libero), swimming.</li>
		<li>I usually overengineer things. Many of my projects were ruined in too complex design.</li>
		<li>In all the computer games I prefer strategies (AOE2 and HOMM3 are the most known). There are also some good RPGs. It's interesting when a game depends on your ability to make desicions.</li>
		<li>I prefer talking to people rather than being assessed through this list. It's difficult to put things together to give enough information about me but not to overwhelm.</li>
